# Club-12

In this project, the main objective was to develop an application that allowed users to maintain an updated list of players and teams. To achieve this, I used Preact and Supabase to create an application that allowed users to securely add, edit, and delete players and teams, as only authorized administrators could access the application. Additionally, the application displayed teams with their shields and players with their photos, and also allowed users to see if teams or players were active or inactive. In summary, a complete set of CRUD operations and custom display features were implemented to ensure a satisfactory and secure user experience.

For security reasons, the code is kept private to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the client. Instead of providing the code, low-quality images are attached that can provide a general idea of the work done. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding of the importance of protecting client data.
